Try to investigate emotion in connection with other variables, like age, gender, psychological state (e.g., depression), political view, ... One can train an emotion classifier, and assign emotions to texts marked for other variables as above. There are annotated corpora for most of these (and more), or it would be easier to obtain through publicly available data.
Trying to answer questions like:
- How does happiness change over age?

Overview of Mental Health Datasets
https://github.com/kharrigian/mental-health-datasets

e.g. SMHD (Self-reported Mental Health Diagnoses) Dataset
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.05258v2.pdf <- paper, which introduces the dataset
https://ir.cs.georgetown.edu/resources/ <- lab website also with more datasets

Unfortunately as stated in data request form (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScC-O3MXDd2lZSGqeRHsv1EMVR2xN5WC0cAodsHK3tBOz_FLw/viewform):
"The datasets are for research purposes only and cannot be made available for class projects or commercial use." 
-> How do we deal with this?
