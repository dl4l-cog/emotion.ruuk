In this project we classified tweets and news articles on the war between Ukraine and Russia according to emotions. Looking at the timelines of different emotions, we traced back certain ones that stood out to major war events. We also compared differences in emotions between different media forms. While this is only correlational data, it might still provide some interesting insight into how the war is perceived in the public eye, specifically on social media and in major news outlets.
